# Anonymous and Secure Voting System

Welcome to the official repository of the Anonymous and Secure Voting System, developed by the P√¥le IT. This project aims to provide a digital voting platform that prioritizes user privacy, security, and transparency.

## üöÄ Features

- Anonymity: Votes are stored using UUIDs, ensuring they cannot be traced back to individual users.
- Security: All communications are encrypted, and the backend includes measures to prevent duplicate voting.
- User-Friendly: Responsive frontend with a confirmation popup to prevent accidental submissions.
- Open Source: Transparency is at the core of this project. The core voting logic is open for audits and improvements.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```cleartext
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vote.php             # Main voting page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process_vote.php     # Backend logic for processing votes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /images              # Assets such as banners or icons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /docs                # Documentation (e.g., LaTeX white paper)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Project overview and usage instructions
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.	Frontend: Users interact with a responsive web interface to cast their votes.
   
- A confirmation popup ensures no accidental submissions.

3.	Backend: Processes votes by:
   
- Generating a unique UUID for each vote.

- Validating the user‚Äôs session to prevent duplicate voting.

5.	Database: Securely stores votes (UUID + vote value), ensuring separation from user data.

### Example Code Snippet
```php
function uuidv4() {
    $data = random_bytes(16);
    $data[6] = chr(ord($data[6]) & 0x0f | 0x40); // version 4
    $data[8] = chr(ord($data[8]) & 0x3f | 0x80); // variant
    return bin2hex($data);
}
```
## üîí Security Measures

- UUID Anonymization: Each vote is associated with a unique identifier, ensuring no link between a voter and their vote.
- Session Validation: Prevents duplicate voting without storing sensitive user information.
- Encrypted Communication: All data exchanges are secured via HTTPS.

## üìú Open Source Philosophy

Transparency is a cornerstone of this project. By making the core voting logic open source, we invite:

	‚Ä¢	Community Audits: Help us identify potential vulnerabilities.

 	‚Ä¢	Contributions: Collaborate to enhance the system.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

	‚Ä¢	PHP 7.4 or higher
	‚Ä¢	MySQL or MariaDB
	‚Ä¢	A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

### Installation

1.	Clone the repository: 
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/bdbcentralesupelec/voting-system.git
cd voting-system
```

2.	Set up the database using the provided schema (located in /docs/schema.sql).
3.	Configure your environment variables in config.php:
```php
$DATABASE_HOST = 'your-db-host';
$DATABASE_USER = 'your-db-user';
$DATABASE_PASS = 'your-db-password';
$DATABASE_NAME = 'your-db-name';
```

4.	Deploy the application on your server.

### Running the System

1.	Open the voting page:

https://your-domain/vote.php


2.	Cast a vote and ensure the confirmation popup is displayed.
3.	Check the database to verify that votes are anonymized and securely stored.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices for Database Credentials

In a production environment, it is crucial to avoid hardcoding database credentials directly into PHP scripts, as shown in some of the example code for simplicity. Instead, credentials such as the database host, username, password, and database name should be stored securely in environment files (.env) or configuration files protected by the server (e.g., .htaccess rules).

### For example, with a .env file:
```cleartext
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASS=your-db-password
DB_NAME=your-db-name
```
### You can then load these variables in PHP using libraries like vlucas/phpdotenv:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();

$DATABASE_HOST = $_ENV['DB_HOST'];
$DATABASE_USER = $_ENV['DB_USER'];
$DATABASE_PASS = $_ENV['DB_PASS'];
$DATABASE_NAME = $_ENV['DB_NAME'];
```

Alternatively, when using Apache or Nginx, you can configure environment variables in the server itself and retrieve them via getenv() in PHP.

These practices enhance security by:

 	‚Ä¢	Preventing accidental leaks of sensitive information if the code is exposed.
	
  	‚Ä¢	Allowing seamless updates to credentials without altering the application code.

	‚Ä¢	Ensuring compliance with modern security standards for web applications.

This project uses simplified code for educational purposes, but we strongly recommend implementing these best practices in any real-world deployment.
