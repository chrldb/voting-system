# Anonymous and Secure Voting System

Welcome to the official repository of the Anonymous and Secure Voting System, developed by the Pôle IT. This project aims to provide a digital voting platform that prioritizes user privacy, security, and transparency.

## 🚀 Features

- Anonymity: Votes are stored using UUIDs, ensuring they cannot be traced back to individual users.
- Security: All communications are encrypted, and the backend includes measures to prevent duplicate voting.
- User-Friendly: Responsive frontend with a confirmation popup to prevent accidental submissions.
- Open Source: Transparency is at the core of this project. The core voting logic is open for audits and improvements.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```cleartext
.
├── vote.php             # Main voting page
├── process_vote.php     # Backend logic for processing votes
├── /images              # Assets such as banners or icons
├── /docs                # Documentation (e.g., LaTeX white paper)
└── README.md            # Project overview and usage instructions
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.	Frontend: Users interact with a responsive web interface to cast their votes.
   
- A confirmation popup ensures no accidental submissions.

3.	Backend: Processes votes by:
   
- Generating a unique UUID for each vote.

- Validating the user’s session to prevent duplicate voting.

5.	Database: Securely stores votes (UUID + vote value), ensuring separation from user data.

### Example Code Snippet
```php
function uuidv4() {
    $data = random_bytes(16);
    $data[6] = chr(ord($data[6]) & 0x0f | 0x40); // version 4
    $data[8] = chr(ord($data[8]) & 0x3f | 0x80); // variant
    return bin2hex($data);
}
```
## 🔒 Security Measures

- UUID Anonymization: Each vote is associated with a unique identifier, ensuring no link between a voter and their vote.
- Session Validation: Prevents duplicate voting without storing sensitive user information.
- Encrypted Communication: All data exchanges are secured via HTTPS.

## 📜 Open Source Philosophy

Transparency is a cornerstone of this project. By making the core voting logic open source, we invite:

- Community Audits: Help us identify potential vulnerabilities.

- Contributions: Collaborate to enhance the system.


## 🛠️ Installation and Usage
